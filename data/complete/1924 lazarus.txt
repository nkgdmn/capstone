The Concerto for Piano and Wood-Winds by Stravinsky establishes a new level in the evolution of the composer of the Sacre du Printemps. Every trace of romanticism is vanished. Objectivity is complete. A tense and terrible striving is apparent from the first to the last note. It is this quality which spoils the work. It lacks grace and spontaneity. Moreover, the deadening resonance of the wood-winds mingles ponderously with the hammered tones of the piano. And yet, from the Concerto emerges the impression of that magnificent fury rarely lacking in Stravinsky.
