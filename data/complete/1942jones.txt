Igor Stravinsky's latest composition, played yesterday afternoon in the Ebell Theater by the Werner Janssen Orchestra, is a successful ballet for woodwinds accompanied by strings. This integrated contemporary of greatest interest in the world today has turned to ballet again in "Danses Concertantes." He provides plenty of imaginative stimuli. Any listener familiar with ballet can visualize the dancers for himself.

Almost a dancer?
His conducting is an aid to the audience as well as the orchestra. It, too, is streamlined and, watching him, one is reminded that it is the merest chance that he wasn't a dancer instead of the most important modern composer to write music for ballet. This was apparent in the new work and in the "Pulincella Suite" (1919) which he played later.

"Danses Concertantes" is compressed, abrupt, and moves rapidly from one idea to another before satiety. Part of it is satire and part sentiment but all of it is concentrated energy, rhythmically exact, highly intense.
